# Decision Tree Classifier Example

## Overview

This Python script showcases the application of a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library for a basic classification task. The dataset simulates the state of a grass patch under different rain and sprinkler conditions. The script covers data preparation, one-hot encoding, training the decision tree, and visualizing the resulting tree structure.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:

# Dataset
The dataset includes three columns: "Rain," "Sprinkler," and "Grass." The script performs one-hot encoding on categorical columns ("Rain" and "Sprinkler") to prepare the data for training.

# Dependencies
Pandas: For data manipulation.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
Graphviz: For generating graph visualizations.
pydotplus: For interaction with Graphviz.
